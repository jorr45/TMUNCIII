           <h3>POLICIES</h3>
            <h4>Registration</h4>
            <p>Space is limited, so registration may close once all spots have been taken.</p>
            <p>Early registration ends <b>December 15th</b>. <br>The deadline to register for the conference is <b>February 2nd</b>.  <br>Any requests to change delegation size must be submitted by <b>February 6th</b>. </p>
            <h4>Pre-written Material</h4>
            <p>Any committee legislation that is submitted for committee and/or dais consideration or discussed with other delegates must be written after the start of Committee Session I. Such legislation includes, but is not limited to: working papers, draft resolutions, directives, communiques, press releases, and war plans. Any delegate found to have pre-written legislation will be disqualified from receiving awards, and his or her team disqualified from receiving a delegation award.</p>
            
            <h4>Laptops</h4>
            <p>Laptop use is permitted outside the committee room for the General Assembly committee (though handwritten legislation will still be accepted), and <i>required</i> in the Ministry of Magic crisis committee. Delegates are expected to use electronic devices appropriately at all times; laptop use while committee is in session must be for committee purposes only.</p>
            <h4>Awards</h4>
            <p>The dais on each committee will determine individual awards for delegates who are most effective in committee. Delegates who submit position papers via email to committee chairs by February 21st will be eligible for a position paper award. Delegations will receive awards on a point-based system, with one award for the Best Delegation and one award for the (second-place) Outstanding Delegation.</p>
            
            <h4>Plagiarism</h4>
            <p>All committee legislation submitted for consideration to the committee and/or dais must be the original work of the sponsors. Any delegate found to have submitted plagiarized material will be disqualified from receiving awards, and his or her team disqualified from receiving a delegation award.</p>
            <h4>Position Paper</h4>
            <p>While not required, position papers are highly encouraged and should be submitted to committee chairs by Saturday, February 21st. Position papers should be limited to one page, single-spaced, include the delegate's committee and country at the top, and include footnoted or endnoted source citation (citations do not count toward the page limit).</p>
